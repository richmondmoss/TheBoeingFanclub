            <p>The Boeing 707 is a mid-sized, long-range, narrow-body, four-engine jet airliner built by Boeing
                Commercial Airplanes from 1958 to 1979. Its name is commonly pronounced as "seven oh seven". Versions of
                the aircraft have a capacity from 140 to 219 passengers and a range of 2,500 to 5,750 nautical miles
                (2,880 to 6,620 mi; 4,630 to 10,650 km).</p>

            <p>Developed as Boeing's first jet airliner, the 707 is a swept-wing design with podded engines. Although it
                was not the first jetliner in service, the 707 was the first to be commercially successful. Dominating
                passenger air transport in the 1960s and remaining common through the 1970s, the 707 is generally
                credited with ushering in the Jet Age. It established Boeing as one of the largest manufacturers
                of passenger aircraft, and led to the later series of airliners with "7x7" designations. The later 720,
                727, 737, and 757 share elements of the 707's fuselage design.</p>

            <p>The Boeing 727 is a midsized, narrow-body three-engined jet aircraft built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes
                from the early 1960s to 1984. It can carry 149 to 189 passengers and later models can fly up to 2,700
                nautical miles (5,000 km) nonstop. Intended for short and medium-length flights, the 727 can use
                relatively short runways at smaller airports. It has three Pratt & Whitney JT8D engines below the
                T-tail, one on each side of the rear fuselage with a center engine that connects through an S-duct to an
                inlet at the base of the fin. The 727 is Boeing's only trijet aircraft.</p>

            <p>The 727 followed the 707, a quad-jet airliner, with which it shares its upper fuselage cross-section and
                cockpit design. The 727-100 first flew in February 1963 and entered service with Eastern Air Lines in
                February 1964; the stretched 727-200 flew in July 1967 and entered service with Northeast Airlines that
                December. The 727 became a mainstay of airlines' domestic route networks and was also used on short- and
                medium-range international routes. Passenger, freighter, and convertible versions of the 727 were
                built.</p>

            <p>The Boeing 737 is a short- to medium-range twinjet narrow-body airliner developed and manufactured by
                Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the United States. Originally developed as a shorter, lower-cost
                twin-engine airliner derived from the 707 and 727, the 737 has developed into a family of ten passenger
                models with capacities from 85 to 215 passengers. The 737 is Boeing's only narrow-body airliner in
                production, with the 737 Next Generation (-700, -800, and -900ER) and the re-engined and redesigned 737
                MAX variants currently being built.</p>

            <p>The 737 was originally envisioned in 1964. The initial 737-100 made its first flight in April 1967, and
                entered airline service in February 1968 at Lufthansa. Next, the lengthened 737-200 entered
                service in April 1968. In the 1980s Boeing launched the longer 737−300, −400, and −500 variants
                (referred to as the Boeing 737 Classic series) featuring CFM56 turbofan engines and wing
                improvements.</p>

            <p>The Boeing 737 Next Generation (NG) was introduced in the 1990s, with a redesigned, increased span
                laminar flow wing, upgraded "glass" cockpit, and new interior.</p>

            <p>The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body twin-engine jet airliner that was designed and built by Boeing
                Commercial Airplanes. It is the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced
                from 1981 to 2004. The twinjet has a two-crew member glass cockpit, turbofan engines of sufficient power
                to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes, a conventional tail and, for
                reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Intended to replace the smaller three-engine 727
                on short and medium routes, the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of 3,150 to 4,100
                nautical miles (5,830 to 7,590 km), depending on variant. The 757 was designed concurrently with a
                wide-body twinjet, the 767 and, owing to shared features, pilots can obtain a common type rating that
                allows them to operate both aircraft.</p>

            <p>The 757 was produced in two fuselage lengths. The original 757-200 entered service in 1983; the
                757-200PF, a package freighter (PF) variant, and the 757-200M, a passenger-freighter combi model,
                debuted in the late 1980s. The stretched 757-300, the longest narrow-body twinjet ever produced,
                began service in 1999. Passenger 757-200s have been modified to special freighter (SF) specification for
                cargo use, while military derivatives include the C-32 transport, VIP carriers, and other multi-purpose
                aircraft. Private and government operators have also customized the 757 for research and transport
                roles. All 757s are powered by Rolls-Royce RB211 or Pratt & Whitney PW2000 series turbofans.</p>
